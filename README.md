I'm an IT & Innovation bachelor student focused on building end-to-end digital products - from code to UI/UX and brand. Alongside my studies, I develop mobile and web solutions with React + TypeScript (and Expo where relevant), prioritizing usability, consistency, and clean design systems.

With a background in digital marketing and analytics, I combine product thinking with measurable improvement - from user journeys and positioning to conversion-focused iteration.

Currently building and shipping projects through Primestreak.
